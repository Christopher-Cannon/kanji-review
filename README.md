# [kanji_review](https://christopher-cannon.github.io/kanji-review/)

This tool will allow you to review 2200 kanji, including the jouyou kanji and some meiyou kanji.

It makes use of the [NihongoShark.com Kanji Deck](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1956010956) 
with changes to two keywords ('wherefore' is now 'therefore' and 'but of course' is now 'still 
more') and cards with alternative kanji have been reduced to just one for consistency.

Select a range within the deck to review and the number of reviews you wish to do. You 
can select anywhere between 10 and 1000 reviews.

Any reviews you get wrong will be present on the results screen at the end of the review session 
with a link to that kanji's entry on [Jisho.org](https://jisho.org/).
